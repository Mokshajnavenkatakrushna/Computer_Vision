1. Introduction
1.1 Overview
Medical imaging plays a crucial role in diagnosing diseases like pneumonia, tuberculosis (TB), and lung cancer. However, raw X-ray images often suffer from noise, poor contrast, and overlapping structures, making analysis difficult. This study explores various image processing methods to improve X-ray quality, extract meaningful features, and segment important regions.

1.2 Objective
The primary goal is to enhance chest X-ray images using image processing techniques, focusing on:
Noise Reduction: Removing unwanted variations for clearer images.
Segmentation & Object Extraction: Isolating significant regions for analysis.
Region-Based Processing: Enhancing specific areas for improved medical interpretation.

1.3 Importance of Image Processing in Medical Imaging
Noise Reduction: Eliminates distortions caused by sensor limitations, patient movement, or environmental factors.
Contrast Enhancement: Highlights key features in medical images.
Segmentation: Helps in isolating lungs, tumors, or infections.
AI Integration: Preprocessed images assist AI models in diagnosing diseases more accurately.


2. Problem Selection & Dataset Preparation
2.1 Problem Selection
Chest X-rays are widely used for detecting lung diseases like TB, but their analysis is complicated by:

Noise artifacts from scanning devices or patient movement.
Segmentation challenges in extracting lung structures.
Low contrast, making disease detection difficult.

2.2 Dataset Overview
The dataset consists of:
Normal Cases: Chest X-rays of healthy individuals.
Tuberculosis Cases: X-rays of patients with TB.
The dataset is sourced from publicly available medical repositories and is well-labeled.

2.3 Preprocessing Steps
Loading: Images are imported using OpenCV and NumPy.
Resizing: Standardizing image dimensions (e.g., 256Ã—256 pixels).
Grayscale Conversion: Converting to grayscale for uniform processing.
Normalization: Scaling pixel values to [0,1].
Data Augmentation: Adding variations like rotation and contrast adjustments for robustness.


3. Noise Reduction Techniques
3.1 Overview
Noise affects image clarity, making diagnosis difficult. Various filtering techniques help remove distortions while preserving critical details.

3.2 Filtering Methods
Gaussian Filter: Smooths high-frequency noise but blurs edges.
Bilateral Filter: Removes noise while preserving edges but is computationally expensive.
Median Filter: Effective against salt-and-pepper noise but less useful for Gaussian noise.
Wiener Filter: Adapts to noise levels but requires precise noise estimation.

3.3 Comparison of Filters
Filter	Strengths	Weaknesses
Gaussian	Removes noise effectively	Blurs fine details and edges
Bilateral	Preserves edges	Computationally expensive
Median	Best for salt-and-pepper noise	Less effective for Gaussian noise
Wiener	Adaptive and detail-preserving	Requires noise variance estimation


4. Segmentation & Object Extraction
4.1 Importance of Segmentation
Segmentation isolates anatomical structures like lungs and detects abnormal patterns.

4.2 Techniques
K-Means Clustering: Groups pixels based on intensity but can introduce artifacts.
Mean Shift Segmentation: Smooths regions but is slow for large images.
Graph-Based Segmentation: Best for detecting lung areas but sensitive to parameters.
4.3 Best Method Selection
Graph-Based Segmentation (Felzenszwalb's Algorithm) is chosen for:

Natural region separation.
Effective lung area extraction.
Reduced over-segmentation.


5. Region-Based Processing
5.1 Methods
Mean Shift Filtering: Smoothens regions while preserving edges.
Connected Component Analysis (CCA): Extracts relevant lung structures from segmented images.

5.2 Advantages
Mean Shift Filtering: Enhances lung contours while reducing noise.
CCA: Identifies and isolates lung areas effectively.


7. Evaluation Metrics
To compare segmentation techniques, the following metrics are used:

6.1 Dice Coefficient (DSC)
Measures overlap between predicted and actual segmentation.
Values range from 0 (no overlap) to 1 (perfect overlap).

6.2 Intersection over Union (IoU)
Evaluates how well the predicted mask matches the ground truth.
IoU is stricter than DSC and penalizes incorrect segmentations more.

6.3 Comparison of Metrics
Metric	Sensitivity	Common Use Cases
DSC	Less strict	Medical segmentation
IoU	Stricter	Object detection, AI models


7. Innovations in the Approach
7.1 Key Innovations
Hybrid Segmentation: Combining classical filtering with deep learning for better accuracy.
